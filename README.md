adept
=====

adept helps you find, declare, and download dependencies.

adept retrieves dependency metadata all at once and identifies artifacts by hashing their content.
This makes adept well-suited for discovering dependencies in addition to being predictable and fast.

adept is currently in the proposal and discussion stage and needs your involvement.
Please see the wiki for the current proposals.

Discuss existing ideas and propose new ones on the development mailing list:

  http://groups.google.com/group/adept-dev/

Although hosted on the sbt organization, adept is intended to be build tool agnostic.
